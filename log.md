### Day 3: Apr-15-18 Sunday 
**Today's Progress**: Forked and cloned node. Build and test done successfully and sent a mail to nodetodo with those. Hoping to get something to work on. 

**Thoughts**: Went through the source code but understood nothing.. :(.. never knew eslintrc can be a JS file with our own rules and all (still not sure about it, but looks like it).. src is filled with .c and .h files.. went through test cases for imports and some other stuff.. this is not going to be easy but I want to understand all these.. hope I do..


### Day 4: Apr-16-18 Monday 
**Today's Progress**: Same as yesterday.. aimlessly went through node code. 

**Thoughts**: Nothing useful came of out of it yet.. maybe I should just stop it here and start with rougelike..


### Day 5: Apr-17-18 Tuesday 
**Today's Progress**: Read about http/2 and played around with it in node. following a medium article. 

**Thoughts**: also read about class vs prototypal inheritance, nodejs streams and some patterns in react.. apart from trying out http/2 nothing much was done today.


### Day 6: Apr-18-18 Wednesday 
**Today's Progress**: Started with rougelike. Did nothing major.. ihaven't even setup repo yet.. was just playing around based on some article and thought that would work but no.. 

**Thoughts**: so confused as to the game itself.. sshould plan and work


### Day 7: Apr-19-18 Thursday 
**Today's Progress**: Same as yesterday..both in terms of what I did and what went wrong.. planning to focus and work on it this weekend. 

**Thoughts**: But learned some cool stuff regarding aws today :)


### Day 8: Apr-20-18 Friday 
**Today's Progress**: Got a task through nodetodo.. it's to changes the assertion method in a test file.. I did and opened a pull request. 

**Thoughts**: It got approved.. Hope all the build succeeds and it gets merged. 

**Link To Work**: [Pull Request](https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/20172)


### Day 9: Apr-21-18 Saturday 
**Today's Progress**: Spent half the day reading code complete. 

**Thoughts**: Didn't know were it came from.. was cleaning my room.. found this and started.


### Day 10: Apr-22-18 Sunday 
**Today's Progress**: Continued to do the same.. spent almost 10% of the book. 

**Thoughts**: Can't believe I spent a whole day with a book. The last time that happened was almost a year ago. Feeling so happy..


### Day 11: Apr-23-18 Monday 
**Today's Progress**: Same as yesterday.. spent the day on book.. was sick 

**Thoughts**: Believe might have completed almost another 5%.. but not so sure..


### Day 12: Apr-24-18 Tuesday 
**Today's Progress**: Same as yesterday.. spent the day on book.. was sick 

**Thoughts**: Nothing much. Thinking may be I should stop with the book and finish rougelike but that also feels like im switching back and forth.. so confused.


### Day 13: Apr-25-18 Wednesday 
**Today's Progress**: Worked on rougelike.. tried generating the progressive map but have been doing only stupid things.

**Thoughts**: Should first decide everything about the game..

### Day 14: Apr-26-18 Thursday 
**Today's Progress**: Looked into and played around with the browser's filesystem api.. 

**Thoughts**: so far I have to been able to read a file.. and write to a file in a sandboxed environment but I still have to figure out to how to expose the files in sandboxed environment.. I looked into it for sometime and most of the answers said it is not possible but I hope there will be a way.. 

**Link To Work**: [FileSystem API - HTML5 Rocks](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/file/filesystem/#toc-file)


### Day 15: Apr-27-18 Friday 
**Today's Progress**: Spent some more time on the filesystem API and tried to identify a way to expose the sandboxed files.

**Thoughts**: One way is to download the file and that is not suited for my case.. so looking into other methods.


### Day 16: Apr-28-18 Saturday  
**Today's Progress**: Started to go my old machine learning notes. Also started off with a course on udemy.

**Thoughts**: Also working on rougelike but that is not seeming to move forward without actually deciding what actually needs to be done.


### Day 17: Apr-29-18 Sunday  
**Today's Progress**: Same as yesterday. Reading notes from Andrew Ng. I am reading because of a need in work.

**Thoughts**: Also finished another 5% of Code Complete.


### Day 18: Apr-30-18 Monday 
**Today's Progress**: Spent time on learning polynomial and random forest regression.

**Thoughts**: Distracting and deviating too much.. Only logging all the time about the need for an action plan but never doing it 😢

### Day 19: May-01-18 Tuesday 
**Today's Progress**: Spent time on the same course. Also learned some interesting stuff about outliers. 

**Thoughts**: Hoping to use all this stuff IRL...


### Day 20: May-02-18 Wednesday 
**Today's Progress**: Spent almost another 2.* hours on code complete.

**Thoughts**: Recently I haven't coded much apart from work and doing some fun things as I look them up on medium. I know I changed the rules to accept learning also but this doesn't feel good.


### Day 21: May-03-18 Thursday 
**Today's Progress**: Worked on a function to test a math statement.. It was quite fun but the function is too simple..

**Thoughts**: Apart from this read couple of articles about MERN stack.


### Day 22: May-04-18 Friday 
**Today's Progress**: Started on some initial prep for journal app. Went through the code I wrote earlier for this. Tried to and use some of that but decided to start fresh.

**Thoughts**: So far decided on React and GraphQL for sure.


### Day 23: May-05-18 Saturday 
**Today's Progress**: Shared about journal with a bunch of friends and almost all of them are in. Should do this in a proper way.

**Thoughts**: Also sent a PR to one of my friend's repo for accepting CLI arguments. It took me some time to understand the code cos of all those threads... but adding the param part was easy.

**Link To Work**: [The-X-Minutes PR](https://github.com/suren99/The-X-Minutes/pull/1)


### Day 24: May-06-18 Sunday 
**Today's Progress**: Looked at some example code bases and rising stack articles on react full stack apps.

**Thoughts**: 😛 Spent some more time with code complete.


### Day 25: May-07-18 Monday 
**Today's Progress**: Worked with a friend to bring up a new ec2 instance and ssh into it using python. Had some trouble with security groups but we resolved it with help of stackoverflow.

**Thoughts**: I am not sure of his usecase though.. creating a instance on runtime.. ? 🤔


### Day 26: May-08-18 Tuesday 
**Today's Progress**: looked into and also tried multiple ways of using css in React for journal.

**Thoughts**: I am still sure about the styled components.. should spend some more time on it.. but for me CSS modules approach feels right.. but not sure on that also.


### Day 27: May-09-18 Wednesday 
**Today's Progress**: Learned a new Design Pattern today. 'Visitor Pattern'. I really enjoyed getting to know about this.

**Thoughts**: Now as we atleast have some idea about the css part, started looking into the Auth part. Trying to find a way to seperate the Auth entirely from the app.


### Day 28: May-10-18 Thursday 
**Today's Progress**: Tried to set up a simple todo app in docker following a medium article and succeeded. Also came up with an approach for Auth but have to discuss with some more people to figure out if it will actually work.

**Thoughts**: The idea is to have a react component that will hand all the auth stuff itself including the server calls and everything.

### Day 29: May-11-18 Friday 
**Today's Progress**: Worked on setting up on basic GraphQL server and wrote basic CRUD APIs.

**Thoughts**: Should start with Prisma tomorrow. Added logs for the whole past week.


### Day 30: May-12-18 Saturday 
**Today's Progress**: Added prisma to the GraphQL Server and repeated the same thing as yesterday.

**Thoughts**: Using [howtographql](https://www.howtographql.com/) to learn these.

### Day 31: May-13-18 Sunday 
**Today's Progress**: Read articles about schema stiching and schema merging in graphQL now Clearly understood how prisma works. 

**Thoughts**: Should complete the remaing things in this (pagination, filtering) and start with the client side of things. Should try to set up a basic codebase by this weekend.


### Day 32: May-14-18 Monday 
**Today's Progress**: Added basic scaffolding with docker and graphql for journal. 

**Thoughts**: Should finish with the Prisma things and client side of things tommorrow. Said the same thing yesterday also.. :(

### Day 33: May-15-18 Tuesday 
**Today's Progress**: Managed to setup a local postgres db and connect to it through prisma. Added this to journal's scaffolding also. 

**Thoughts**: But unable to start app graphql server. Posted about it on prisma fourm.

### Day 34: May-16-18 Wednesday 
**Today's Progress**: Fixed the issue I was facing yesterday. II didn't import the generated schema.. That was the reason for it. But now facing another issue. 

**Thoughts**: I am able to access the prisma server directly and run queries but when I try to do it using the app's graphql server, it says unable to connect to prisma graphql server and fails. Asked for help in prisma forum and stackoverflow.

### Day 35: May-17-18 Thursday 
**Today's Progress**: Followed howtographql and tried out setting up local auth and started off with subscriptions. 

**Thoughts**: Also got help from prisma forum to solve the ECONNREFUSED error. Its because of the fact the localhost inside a container points to the container as such.. I have to use the service name with its port to access it. Now its working.

**Thoughts**: Followed and implemented subscription, filtering, pagination and sorting on a dummy project.


### Day 37: May-19-18 Saturday 
**Today's Progress**: Started with react + appolo client on howtographql. 

**Thoughts**: Also tried to have a bootstrap script for the graphql server in docker and run it.. but was having some issues. Asusual i must have missed something. should try to fix it tomorrow.


### Day 38: May-20-18 Sunday 
**Today's Progress**: Created a PR for basic graphql and prisma set up along with docker. 

**Thoughts**: Updated docker-compose.yml, prisma and graphql configs to used env variables. Added babel, linting and husky. 

**Link To Work**: [add: scaffolding for docker, graphql and babel, lint #1](https://github.com/dhanushuUzumaki/Journal/pull/1)


### Day 39: May-21-18 Monday 
**Today's Progress**: Added graphdoc for static documentation and apollo engine for monitoring to journal. 

**Thoughts**: Tried to set up reverse proxy using traefik. But it's not working as expected. Asked in their slack channel and also in stackoverflow. Hope someone helps me with this. 

**Link To Work**: [Journal - Today's commit](https://github.com/dhanushuUzumaki/Journal/commit/8e64c39f1ae9820544b9b62f74759225bee1a30e)


### Day 40: May-22-18 Tuesday 
**Today's Progress**: I wasn't able to identify what is wrong with traefik.. Then got help from michael (traefik maintainer). We spent almost 1-2 hours or more trying to identify what is going wrong, but we couldn't. So we called it a day. Should try to fix it tomorrow.

**Thoughts**: I never thought I could get this much help non-commercially. Traefik is really awesome. 🎉 💯

### Day 41: May-23-18 Wednesday 
**Today's Progress**: Somehow.. I managed to get both the traefik dashboard and graphql server running parallely (that was not working yesterday. and its not a port issue).. I don't know why it didn't work yesterday and why it is working today.. maybe somemore digging will help but I stopped there.. but still traefik proxy is not working as expected. 

**Thoughts**: Messaged michael for help again.. Hope he replies 🤞

### Day 42: May-24-18 Thursday 
**Today's Progress**: Michael helped again today. We got it working. https://api.journal.com is now successfully redirecting to my http graphql server in local. 

**Thoughts**: Reviewed one of my friend's code. Reviewed with what I knwo.. might have been stupid also.. :D


### Day 43: May-25-18 Friday 
**Today's Progress**: Continued with the client side of graphql in howtographql.com. 

**Thoughts**: Also had whole day mulesoft training session in office and learned a lot of things... :) so happy <3


### Day 44: May-26-18 Saturday 
**Today's Progress**: Had a full day training on mulesoft at office. Reviewed the mockups of journal with ganesh.

**Thoughts**: Spent some time on reading about apollo-client apart from howtographql.


### Day 45: May-27-18 Sunday 
**Today's Progress**: Explained what I have done so far in terms of scaffolding and configs to two people and spent some more time on howtogqphql's frontend track. 

**Thoughts**: Watched some of wes bos's videos


### Day 46: May-28-18 Monday 
**Today's Progress**: Added winston and morgan logging to journal. 

**Thoughts**: Saw some pwa videos from google.

### Day 47: May-29-18 Tuesday 
**Today's Progress**: Completed the frontend part on howtographql. 

**Thoughts**: Feel like lot of the things are managed by apollo packages. Should start with the react-client scaffolding of journal tomorrow.


### Day 48: May-30-18 Wednesday 
**Today's Progress**: Read a very interesting article about code readability, followed by another article on certain es7 and js features. 

**Thoughts**: Started off with the client side implementation of journal also.. but confused whether we need all those apollo packages or can we do it ourselves. Should contemplate on it for some more time. Hope to have the complete scaffolding ready by friday eve.

### Day 49: May-31-18 Thursday 
**Today's Progress**: Started off with the client side of journal.

**Thoughts**: Used generator-uzumaki for basic scaffolding and tried adding apollo and realted to it. but things weren't working as expected. Not sure whether it's something to do with docker networking or something else.


### Day 50: Jun-01-18 Friday 
**Today's Progress**: Continued what I was doing yesterday. Still haven't found the root cause of the issue. Maybe I should add wait-for-it to this also but that doesn't make any sense. :( 

**Thoughts**: Should complete all this before tomorrow evening and start backlog grooming. Hope all this is resolved and have some working scaffolding in place.


### Day 51: Jun-02-18 Saturday 
**Today's Progress**: Removed all the code from react client and started to set it up again. Migrated it to webpack 4 but faced some issues with webpack-dev-server. So wreported it and merged the code to develop. 

**Thoughts**: Explained the current code base to the guys and the fix for webpack-dev-server has been merged should pull that after being published. 

**Link To Work**: [Journal - Develop](https://github.com/dhanushuUzumaki/Journal)


### Day 52: Jun-03-18 Sunday 
**Today's Progress**: Got the webpack dev server working.. webpack-cli released a patch to fix the issue.

**Thoughts**: Also started looking to passing env variables to build and deploying prisma on running the container. Tried installing prisma globally and doing things but that doesn't work as expected. Also having some problem with node-sass in the container. 🌋

### Day 53: Jun-04-18 Monday 
**Today's Progress**: Successfully passed env varibles into build and created a env file for prisma to use in the container but connecting that to the running service seems difficult.. host.docker.internal is not resolved during build. May be I am missing something. Also set up a rds and connected to prisma and it worked 🍾 

**Thoughts**: Still haven't touched the react-client side of things.. should have kept it with what I had.. started to rewrite it and all hell is lose now :( But hoping to have the whole things neatly done by this weekend.. It's already delayed. :(

### Day 54: Jun-05-18 Tuesday 
**Today's Progress**: Made changes to the dockerfile and compose file. Made changes to run prisma deploy when docker container is started. 

**Thoughts**: Got to learn some pretty intersting things about docker volumes and how they affect certain things. Stumbled on an excellent article which explained all these. 

**Link To Work**: [Journal - Today's Commit](https://github.com/dhanushuUzumaki/Journal/commit/05dd746adbf5753f0f16d7c5588e08d0fccf262a)


### Day 55: Jun-06-18 Wednesday 
**Today's Progress**: Worked on journal, setting up travis build and test, docker auto builds (not working). 

**Thoughts**: Rewrote the configs for react client, changed scaffloding and added jest for testing and tested all together with travis. :) So Happy.

### Day 56: Jun-07-18 Thursday 
**Today's Progress**: Added Input and nav component to journal. This is to set up a basic scaffolding only.. Too much time is spent on the scaffolding rather than the actual app. Hoping to completely wrap this up this week. 

**Thoughts**: Used a scotch.io article for input component and nav component is from a pen. Should set up router and redux and integrate with graphql. Also should make some progress on the docker auto build. Stackoverflow answers for my question result in the fact that docker-compose can't be used on autobuilds.. but I am still looking out. If it's not possible should add configuration for building them seperately in docker-hub.
