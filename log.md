### Day 3: Apr-15-18 Sunday 
**Today's Progress**: Forked and cloned node. Build and test done successfully and sent a mail to nodetodo with those. Hoping to get something to work on. 

**Thoughts**: Went through the source code but understood nothing.. :(.. never knew eslintrc can be a JS file with our own rules and all (still not sure about it, but looks like it).. src is filled with .c and .h files.. went through test cases for imports and some other stuff.. this is not going to be easy but I want to understand all these.. hope I do..


### Day 4: Apr-16-18 Monday 
**Today's Progress**: Same as yesterday.. aimlessly went through node code. 

**Thoughts**: Nothing useful came of out of it yet.. maybe I should just stop it here and start with rougelike..


### Day 5: Apr-17-18 Tuesday 
**Today's Progress**: Read about http/2 and played around with it in node. following a medium article. 

**Thoughts**: also read about class vs prototypal inheritance, nodejs streams and some patterns in react.. apart from trying out http/2 nothing much was done today.


### Day 6: Apr-18-18 Wednesday 
**Today's Progress**: Started with rougelike. Did nothing major.. ihaven't even setup repo yet.. was just playing around based on some article and thought that would work but no.. 

**Thoughts**: so confused as to the game itself.. sshould plan and work


### Day 7: Apr-19-18 Thursday 
**Today's Progress**: Same as yesterday..both in terms of what I did and what went wrong.. planning to focus and work on it this weekend. 

**Thoughts**: But learned some cool stuff regarding aws today :)


### Day 8: Apr-20-18 Friday 
**Today's Progress**: Got a task through nodetodo.. it's to changes the assertion method in a test file.. I did and opened a pull request.

### Day 9: Apr-21-18 Saturday 
**Today's Progress**: Spent half the day reading code complete. 

**Thoughts**: Didn't know were it came from.. was cleaning my room.. found this and started.


### Day 10: Apr-22-18 Sunday 
**Today's Progress**: Continued to do the same.. spent almost 10% of the book. 

**Thoughts**: Can't believe I spent a whole day with a book. The last time that happened was almost a year ago. Feeling so happy..


### Day 11: Apr-23-18 Monday 
**Today's Progress**: Same as yesterday.. spent the day on book.. was sick 

**Thoughts**: Believe might have completed almost another 5%.. but not so sure..
